### Explanation - Any one use case from Unit 5 and write the prompt for that with the unit 2 Prompt types given above.

## Procedure:
1.	Define the Scenario and Use Case:
Scenario:
The manufacturing industry is looking to reduce manual monitoring and increase efficiency through automation. The system will utilize IoT devices and embedded controllers to automate equipment, monitor performance, and enable predictive maintenance. The goal is to streamline the production process, minimize downtime, and enhance energy efficiency.
Target Audience:
Manufacturing companies, specifically in sectors like automotive, electronics, and food processing, where automation can significantly improve productivity.

Main Objectives:

•	Improve production efficiency by 30%.
•	Minimize machinery downtime with predictive maintenance.
•	Enable real-time monitoring and remote control of manufacturing systems.
•	Reduce energy consumption by optimizing processes.
 
2.	Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect:
Idea Generation Prompts:

Comparative Analysis Prompt
Definition: Asking for a comparison between two or more concepts, often highlighting similarities and differences.
•	"Compare and contrast deep learning and machine learning."
•	"How do renewable and non-renewable energy sources differ?"

Experiential Perspective Prompt:
> 	“As a software engineer, what are the benefits of using cloud computing in your projects?”
>  “From a student’s perspective, describe the challenges of online learning.”

Everyday Functioning Prompts:
*	  “Describe the role of machine learning in everyday apps like YouTube or Netflix."
*	 	“How is encryption used in daily life when sending WhatsApp messages?”

Universal Prompt Structures:
^ 	“Explain [concept] in simple terms with an example.”
^  “Explain the process of [task] step by step.”

Prompt Size Limitations:
&  	“Translate this 5000-word essay into Tamil.”
→ Manageable chunks: “Translate the first 1000 words into Tamil, then continue.”
&  “Give me 50 examples of AI applications.”
→ Adjust for size: “Give me 10 AI applications at a time.”

## OUTPUT :

### 1. Comparative Analysis Prompt:
Definition:
Asks the AI to compare two or more items based on criteria.
Generated Prompt:
"Compare Online Learning and Traditional Classroom Learning in terms of Accessibility, Cost, and Effectiveness."
Evaluation:
The AI will generate a side-by-side comparison highlighting pros and cons. This helps decision-making and gives structured understanding.
Strength: Clear contrasts and structured knowledge.
Limitation: Might oversimplify nuanced differences.

### 2. Experiential Perspective Prompt
Definition:
Asks the AI to answer from a specific person’s or group’s lived experience.
Generated Prompt:
"Explain the challenges of remote work from the perspective of a software developer."
Evaluation:
The response will reflect personalized challenges (distractions, communication delays, isolation) making the answer relatable.
Strength: Adds realism and empathy.
Limitation: AI may generate generalized rather than authentic personal experiences.

### 3. Everyday Functioning Prompt
Definition:
Relates to common daily-life situations where AI provides practical assistance.
Generated Prompt:
"Create a simple daily routine plan for a college student balancing classes, part-time work, and fitness."
Evaluation:
The AI provides practical schedules, aligning to real-world usability.
Strength: High user relevance.
Limitation: May not account for personal variations (e.g., energy levels, cultural routines).


### 4. Universal Prompt Structures
 Definition:
Prompts designed in general reusable formats that can adapt to multiple scenarios.
Generated Prompt:
"Explain [Concept] in simple terms, provide one example, and list two applications."
(Example: Explain Blockchain in simple terms, provide one example, and list two applications.)
Evaluation:
AI produces consistent, structured, and reusable responses across topics.
Strength: Standardized, scalable format.
Limitation: Can become repetitive if not customized.

### 5. Prompt Refinements – Prompt Size Limitations
Definition:
Examines how length/complexity of prompts affects output quality.
Generated Prompt (Lengthy):
"Explain Artificial Intelligence by covering its definition, history, applications in various domains like healthcare, education, and finance, advantages, disadvantages, ethical issues, and future scope in a single response."
Refined Prompt (Concise):
"Explain Artificial Intelligence with its definition, two applications, and one ethical issue."
Evaluation:
Long prompts → risk of overwhelming or vague responses.
Short, refined prompts → focused and higher-quality answers.
 Strength: Precision improves clarity and relevance.
 Limitation: Over-refinement may omit important context.

## Conclusion:
Different prompting strategies yield varied response qualities:

Comparative → structured contrasts

Experiential → realistic perspectives

Everyday → practical guidance

Universal → reusable formats

Refinements → balance detail vs. clarity

Thus, careful selection and refinement of prompt type improves AI output effectiveness in different contexts.

## Result:
The various types of Prompts are executed successfully with generated the report.
